*Tap mine, I'll tap yours!*

[`LEDswarm`](https://github.com/LEDswarm) is a game where a group of people each hold a green light, which turns red if it is moved too quickly. The goal is to keep your own light green while pushing (softly) on the other light rods to make them red. Being green or red determines if you're still in the round or not.

# Round

1. **Blue Light**

Before the action starts, all lights are blue. 
The moment when all of them turn green starts the round.

2. **Green Light**

People start moving now, slowly, to avoid turning their own LED red, and move towards other participants to try to move their lights in just the right way to make them red.

Alliances may form and the game takes its course.

3. **Red Light**

The last light to turn red may then be declared as the round winner.
